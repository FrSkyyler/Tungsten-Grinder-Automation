What I need to do when I come back:
1) Mount limit switches
2) Test direction of motors
3) Test servos and ensure they are in the currect position
4) Test how many steps it takes to do a full rotation (either 200, 400, 800)
5) Impliment a total length prompt
	Prompt if user is wanting to sharpen a certain length
	     if yes then prompt user for overall length
		compute what the overall length you need to go back so the spindal can move with no interferance
	     if no then use defualt length of 7in (this is a total of 5.5in) this should be close to the home position
6) Figure out the correct number of steps to take to fully loosen and tighten the chuck (probably around 2 rotations)
7) Create possible errors that could happen and display them on the screen so user can troubleshoot
8) Comment code so if someone is reading it then it makes sense
9) Create a total tutorial (what programs I used, the steps to upload code to the microcontroller, the different error codes that can appear,
	what they mean, and how to troubleshoot them, the total process that the machine takes and what to look out for in the first couple cycles, 
	what to do if the machine is having touble, how to turn the machine on and off using by the surge protector, terminal blocks, and on/off button) 
10) Add code that prompts the user if they are ready for sharpening to begin so they have adequite time to add tungsten in hopper
11) Change all the Serial printlns to display printlns

What Conner and Trever can do before:
1) Strengthen up mount for the hopper (talked about adding gussets, mounting legs to table, etc.)
2)










Things to do 9/16/2022:
Done 1) Test out the different sizes array for the display and encoder
Done 2) Play with counting down each time it runs
Done 3) Solder limit switches for hopper, loading spindal, arm home, and carriage hard limit switch
Done Kinda 4) Figure out servo mounting
Done 5) Figure out how to wire DM320T's
Done 6) Test moving a stepper and using a limit swtich (prefer using a stepper that is not connected to anything just in case)
Done 7) Wire servos (aka extend the lengths)
Done 8) Once sheet metal plate for mounting gets here, mount electronics in electrical box
Done 9) Once sorting discs get here, mount and weld them on to SST rod
Done (3D printed part) 10) Weld a piece of sheet metal to the stepper coupling to be able to figure out home postion
Done 11) Build hopper with legs and mount to linear actuator
12) Mount limit switches to correct spots and insure that they all are working properly and are secure
13) Cable manage all of the wires (especially those that are coming from the arm rotating stepper and the chuck spinner)
Done 14) Fully seat the bearing for the chuck, tighten the stepper motor, and attach the 3D printed gear to chuck
Done 15) Mount surge protector into box and drill hole for plug to come out of
